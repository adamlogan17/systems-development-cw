This is my coursework submission for my Year 2 Software Engineering & Systems Development module. For my work on this project I was awarded the Civica award, as I achieved the highest mark within this module.

Due to the coursework being a group project, I did not complete all the work myself. The work which I did myself has been highlighted in the minutes and the peer assessment forms within both the reports. The details of the coursework can be found within the 'Specification for Coursework' document.

### How do I get started? ###
1. Make sure your JDK supports Java SE 11 or later
2. Open the project ```Technopoly``` in eclipse
3. Run the file ```Game.java```
